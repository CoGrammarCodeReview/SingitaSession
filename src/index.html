          <br />
          <p> At Adventure Time Daycare we believe that every child is capable of excellence. 
            That is why we are committed to pursuing and maintaining our status as an 
            accredited daycare center. By seeking national accreditation, you know 
            that Trusted Friends is striving to give your family the very 
            best daycare experience.</p>
         <h2 id="acc2">What is Accreditation?</h2>
         <p>Every daycare center must meet the state's minimum license requirements. 
            We go beyond that. When a daycare center is awarded national accreditation 
            they are meeting a higher standard that demonstrates its expertise in:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Classroom Management</li>
            <li>Curriculum Development</li>
            <li>Health and Safety</li>
            <li>Parental Support</li>
            <li>Community Involvement</li>
            <li>Teacher Certification</li>
            <li>Administrative Oversight</li>
            <li>Financial Statements</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Our commitment to accreditation gives you assurance we provide a positive 
            educational experience for your child.</p>
         <h2 id="acc3">How does Accreditation Work?</h2>
         <p>Every other year we go through an intense review by recognized and esteemed 
            national accreditation agencies. Their positive reports (available for 
            inspection) confirm that we are providing a clean, safe, and positive 
            environment for our children. Accreditation verifies that our teachers are 
            qualified and fully engaged in giving our children a first-class educational 
            experience.</p>
         <p>Once we've completed the entire accreditation self-study process, trained 
            professionals from our accrediting agencies conduct on-site visits to 
            validate our compliance with national early childhood education standards.
            But accreditation doesn't just take place every two years. It's an ongoing 
            process of self-evaluation, discussion, and parental reviews.</p>
         <p>We encourage parents to help us improve our center and become better stewards for 
            their children. You can part of the accreditation process as we work together
            to make Trusted Friends a great neighborhood center.</p>
         <h2 id="acc4">Who Provides Accreditation?</h2>
         <p>There are several national organizations that provide accreditation services.
            Who a center chooses for oversight is important. Trusted Friends pursues national 
            accreditation from three of the most 
            respected national early childhood accreditation agencies:</p>
